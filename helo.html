<section class="about">
    <p>The dog evolved from the gray wolf into more than 400 distinct breeds. Human beings have played a 
        major role in creating dogs that fulfill distinct societal needs. Through the most rudimentary form 
        of genetic engineering, dogs were bred to accentuate instincts that were evident from their earliest 
        encounters with humans. Although details about the evolution of dogs are uncertain, the first dogs 
        were hunters with keen senses of sight and smell. Humans developed these instincts and created new 
        breeds as need or desire arose.
